## Introduction

With the rapid advancements in Quantum Computing, there's a growing need for Machine Learning models that can understand, categorize, and analyze the vast number of research papers in the domain. This project provides a toolset to create datasets from these papers, which can be used to train such models.

## Features

- **Rust Backend**: Efficient data processing using Rust.
- **arXiv Integration**: Directly fetch and process Quantum Computing papers from arXiv.
- **Extensible**: Easily add more sources or modify existing ones.
- **Clean Data**: Pre-processing scripts to clean and standardize the data.

## Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable version)
- Other dependencies (list any other major dependencies here)
